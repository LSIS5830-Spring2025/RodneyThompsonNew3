description: The 1990s marked a pivotal decade in hip hop, transforming it from a rising street movement into a dominant cultural force worldwide. This era featured the emergence of influential artists and groups such as Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest, and Outkast. Characterized by lyrical complexity, social commentary, and diverse regional styles—from East Coast boom bap to West Coast G-funk and Southern bounce—the genre evolved both sonically and culturally. The 1990s also saw the rise of hip hop as a commercial powerhouse, with increasing influence in fashion, film, and mainstream media.
